# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data. The model learns to predict outputs based on inputs.
   - Classification: Predicting a category (e.g., spam detection)
   - Regression: Predicting a continuous value (e.g., house prices)

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data and finds patterns on its own.
   - Clustering: Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation)
   - Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
   - Used in robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems
